# When a work item splits

**Sustained task growth is a failure of something.** A work item that keeps 
gaining tasks will never close - that is arithmetic, not judgment - so task
growth is a measurement and it is the one that tells you to look.

**What it does not tell you is which failure.** Reaching straight for a split
gets it wrong three times in four, because three of the four causes are defects
in the outcomes and are fixed by editing outcome(s).

**One burst of tasks is not growth.** Discovery is what doing the work is for,
and a work item that never gains a task was trivially scoped or nobody learned
anything. The signal is the *trend*: tasks still arriving after the work is
understood, or outcomes that are not advancing.

**Two different things grow, and they mean different things.**

- **A work item gaining tasks** - diagnose it, below.
- **A task growing in size** - that task failed. It was one task too big, and
  splitting it is not a scoping decision, it is a correction. A task nobody
  could start without asking a question was never worked out.

## Diagnose before splitting

`spec.md` §5.2 already names all four causes as conditions.

### The outcome has no edge

An outcome that can never be finally true will absorb tasks forever. *The corpus
is clean.* *The tool is good.* There is no state at which somebody could say it
holds, so nothing ever finishes.

**Two fixes, and both are better than a split.**

- **Bound it.** A Redefine that *narrows* --- *"and stop at a hundred"* --- is
  the model working, not a retreat. It is very often the right answer to sprawl.
- **Move it.** An outcome that must hold *continuously* rather than *eventually*
  is a **standing condition**, and §5.2 is where those live. It was never an
  outcome; it was an invariant wearing one's clothes.

### Nobody can tell what is left

`outcome.unmeasured` --- an outcome with no `verify_by`. Without a check, no
task can be the last one, so tasks keep being written to be safe.

**Write the check.** The flow usually stops on its own, because somebody can
finally see the edge.

### Work happened and the outcomes never moved

`work-item.drifted` --- *"work happened, but no outcome was verified or revised;
the specification has fallen behind reality."*

**The outcomes are meant to change.** `lifecycle.md` §2.8 has a phase for it ---
*Redefine*, at the wave boundary, asking *was that the right definition of
done?* Skipping it is the failure. **Revising an outcome is not a smell; never
revising one while tasks pile up is.**

**What is a smell is expansion without governance.** Redefine "requires
governance" precisely because it is where goalposts get moved. A definition that
grows at every boundary and never narrows is somebody avoiding an ending.

### The task serves nothing here

`task.advances-nothing` --- a task attached to no outcome. **This is the only
one that can be a split**, and it is not one yet. Ask which outcome it advances:

- **It advances one** --- growth. Leave it alone.
- **It advances one nobody wrote down** --- write the outcome. Still one work
  item.
- **The outcome it would need is a different definition of done** --- **now it
  is a split.**

## The reciprocal test

**If you cannot write outcomes for the new work item that differ from the old
one's, it is not a work item.** It is a task, and splitting produces a task list
with ceremony --- which is worse than the sprawl, because the unit stops meaning
anything.

## Check when the task is written, not in a review

**Ask at creation: which outcome does this advance?** It costs one question, and
the answer is the whole diagnosis above. Finding it sessions later means
archaeology --- reconstructing why each task exists from records written by
somebody who already knew.

## The cost nobody counts

**The journal does not split.** It belongs to the work item, and the new one
starts with none --- so the reasoning that produced its tasks stays on the
parent, where nobody will look for it.

Measured on the split that produced this policy: the parent had sixty-eight
journal lines and the new work item began with six, all of them the file's own
header.

**Copy the lines across; never move them.** `spec.md` §4.8.1 --- *promotion
copies, it never moves* --- and link back. Losing the reasoning is a worse
outcome than a work item that was slightly too big.

## What size tells you, and what it does not

**Count is a trigger, not a diagnosis.** Twenty tasks says *look*; it does
not say *split*. Twenty tasks spanning three definitions of done is a
split. Twenty tasks against one unbounded outcome is a bounding problem
and splitting it produces two work items that also never close.

**Rate is the sharper number, and the unit is the session.** Not the calendar
--- a work item here may be created, worked and closed inside one session, and
several may be. **Count sessions, not elapsed time**, and every threshold below
holds whether a session ran twenty minutes or all evening.

| | reads as |
| --- | --- |
| doubling **early in a session** | discovery. Expected, and the work being understood. |
| still arriving **late in the same session**, after the work is understood | one of the four causes. Diagnose it. |
| still arriving **in a third session** | not discovery any more. Something is unbounded or undefined. |

**Ask what arrived since the last outcome moved.** It is clock-free, it is the
sharpest form of the question, and it stays right whoever is working --- if the
answer is *everything*, that is `work-item.drifted` and not a scoping question
at all.

**Untouched across sessions is a signal here**, where in a human backlog it
would be noise. Sessions are frequent; a work item nobody has opened in several
is either finished and unclosed, or blocked on something nobody wrote down.

**Discomfort is worth investigating and is never the reason.** Run the
diagnosis. The feeling is usually one of the first three causes, and none of
those is a split.

## The bias

**Splitting late is better than splitting early.** Late costs archaeology and a
severed journal. Early costs a work item that cannot say what done means, which
never recovers --- and every later reader inherits the confusion about what the
thing was for.

## Journal the split, so it can be judged later

**A split is a decision made under uncertainty, and nothing else records it.**
Git says which files moved; only the journal can say why, and whether it was
right. Write it on **both** work items --- the one that stayed and the one that
was created --- because a reader arriving at either should not have to find the
other to understand what happened.

Answer what a retro would ask:

- **What made us notice, and why not sooner?** The lag is the useful part. If a
  work item was sprawling for two sessions before anybody looked, the signal
  existed and nothing surfaced it.
- **Which of the four causes was it?** Name it. A split recorded as *it got big*
  teaches nothing; *the outcome had no edge* teaches the next diagnosis.
- **What actually moved**, and what stayed, and the test that separated them.
- **What we tried first.** A bounding outcome that did not hold, a rewritten
  `verify_by` that did not stop the flow --- the attempts that failed are the
  half that is otherwise lost.
- **What we would do differently**, and **what would tell us sooner.** These are
  the two that pay: one improves the next split, the other means there may not
  need to be one.

**Come back to it.** A split is a prediction --- that these are two things ---
and it is falsifiable. If both halves closed cleanly, say so on the next visit.
If one absorbed the other's work anyway, that is worth more than the original
entry, and it is the only way this policy improves.

**Journal lines do not move with the tasks.** Copy the ones the new work item
needs and link back; `spec.md` §4.8.1 --- *promotion copies, it never moves*.
Measured on the split that produced this policy: the parent kept sixty-eight
lines and the new work item began with six, all of them the file's own header.
