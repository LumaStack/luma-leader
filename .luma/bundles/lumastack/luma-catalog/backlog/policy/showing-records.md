# Showing records

**Every procedure that prints records prints them the same way.** Two that
render the same thing differently teach a reader to look in two places, and the
difference is never deliberate — it is one of them having been edited.

## The marks

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `○` | not started — a `todo` task, an unverified outcome |
| `◐` | under way — `in_progress` |
| `✔` | delivered, success, or proven — it came out |
| `↪` | superseded — picked up elsewhere |
| `⊘` | cancelled or missing — switched off on purpose, or never there |
| `✘` | error, failed, or abandoned — it did not come out |

**Unfinished work shares the circle; finished work changes shape.** `○` and `◐`
are one thing at two points, and the fill is the progress. A filled circle for
*done* would join that family and be mistaken for an empty one down a column, so
done leaves the circle entirely and separates before anything is read.

**`⊘` is a decision; `✘` is the absence of one, or the failure of one.** That is
the whole line between them, and recording an abandonment as a cancellation
invents a choice nobody made.

**Use the heavy `✔` U+2714 and `✘` U+2718**, not the light pair. The light marks
are thinner than the circles beside them, so a finished row reads as fainter
than an unfinished one — backwards, since finished work is what a scan skips.

**Do not invent a state the record does not claim.** Most of these have nowhere
to come from yet: an outcome is `unverified` or `passing` with nothing between,
and ADR-0007's verdicts are unbuilt. Absence is `○`, not `✘` — nobody having
looked is not a bad result, it is no result.

## Mentioning a record

**In ephemeral output, a key carries its title at least once per turn.** A
reply, a report, a board — anything shown to somebody now and gone afterwards.
`WORK-0001` on its own asks the reader to have memorised every key in the
corpus. It need not be at the first mention, only somewhere in the same turn,
because forcing it first would fight whatever else is deciding the shape of that
line.

**Where the key is part of a form being shown — a template, an example, a
command — the form decides.** A listing is already `mark · key · title`, so it
satisfies this by construction. `rank WORK-0011 --first` deliberately does not,
and a title there corrupts the shape being demonstrated. **This rule never edits
a form; it fills the gap forms do not cover, which is sentences.**

**In durable output, reference the key alone.** A record, a procedure, a
journal, a commit message. A title written into any of them is frozen at the
moment of writing and is wrong the first time somebody renames the record. **The
key does not change; the title does** — and ephemeral output can carry a title
safely precisely because it does not outlive the question it was answering.

## Numbers to use in an example

**A recommendation, not a rule.** Where an example needs a key, these read as
examples at a glance:

```
WORK-0001  WORK-0011  WORK-0111  WORK-1111
WORK-0002  WORK-0022  WORK-0222  WORK-2222
```

**A repeated digit is unmistakably artificial** --- nobody meets `WORK-2222` and
wonders whether to look it up --- and the widths vary, so an example does not
quietly teach that a key is always four characters.

**Take one family per set of records a passage must keep apart**, and reuse them
freely across passages that have nothing to do with each other.

**Nothing enforces this and nothing should.** These are ordinary numbers a real
corpus reaches on its first day, so they protect nothing; they only make an
example recognisable as one. An example that needs a ninth number, or reads
better with a different one, is not doing anything wrong.

## A list of records

**Mark, key, title — and the key only when the record has one.**

```
○ WORK-0111 · Migrate a corpus when the vocabulary changes
✔ WORK-1111 · Extract the application layer
```

Outcomes and tasks carry no key, so they are mark and title alone:

```
○ Every command is noun then verb
✔ Build the noun-verb command tree
```

**Fixed order: `○ ◐ ✔ ↪ ⊘ ✘`.** Endings last, the bad one last of all. **Within
a state, keep the order the command returned** — do not re-sort. Any ordering
the records carry is one somebody chose.

**A heading carries the tally**, so counts are read once rather than by counting
rows: *Tasks (23) — 9 delivered, 14 not started*.

**Every record gets its own line, finished ones included.** A finished record is
how somebody learns a thing was already tried, and a list showing only what is
left makes work look like it began this morning. The marks are what keep a long
list readable.

## The command that produced it

**Show it, directly below the list, every time — empty results especially.**

```
luma-backlog work-item list --status closed
```

It says which filter ran, so an empty result is distinguishable from a wrong
question; it can be re-run; and it can be edited into the next question.

**And it teaches the command line.** Somebody who asks in English and is shown
`--status closed` learns the flag without being taught it. **A procedure that
answers questions forever has failed** — this is how it makes itself less
necessary.

**Below, never above.** The answer comes first; provenance follows it.
