## The rules the shape depends on

**No numbers on headings.** They are sections, not steps, and a reader who
arrives at *3.* wonders what they missed.

**Every heading is `###`.** One level, so the four sections above the rule read
as four sections rather than a hierarchy --- there is no containment between
them and a size difference would imply one.

**The order runs from least to most immediate, because a terminal is read from
the bottom.** The last line printed sits at the cursor and costs nothing;
everything above it costs a scroll. So the speculative end goes first ---
preparation, then the queue, then what is live --- and the two things somebody
actually came for, the risks and where they left off, sit nearest the prompt.

**This is the opposite of how a document is ordered**, and deliberately. A page
is read top-down and leads with the most important thing. A terminal is read
bottom-up, and leading with the most important thing means burying it.

> It is also the opposite of what a **command** should do: `list` must not
> reverse, because its output gets piped and `| head` would silently take the
> wrong end. Nothing pipes a report, so the constraint does not carry across.

**Risks stays above Last touched and below the listings.** It refers to the
records above it --- *"WORK-0111 has 23 tasks"* means nothing before WORK-0111
has appeared --- so it cannot lead, and it is the second thing worth reading, so
it sits second from the bottom.

**Risks is a bulleted list, one concern per bullet.** A run of paragraphs hides
the count --- one risk and four look alike until both have been read --- and
this is the section somebody scans to decide whether to worry. A bullet may run
to a second sentence; it may not run to a paragraph, and whatever makes it
checkable --- the number, the record, the file and line --- goes in the first
clause where a scan will find it.

**Plain bullets, never the state marks.** A risk is not a record and has no
state, so `○` and `✔` do not belong here. [[showing-records]] governs rows that
stand for records; these stand for nothing but themselves.

**Last touched is prose, and the only prose in the overview.** What happened is
usually more than a record and a timestamp, and the contrast is what makes it
read as the one section written rather than tallied.

**It says whether the reader left mid-flight or at a clean stop**, because the
last record touched is often a closed one. Those are different positions ---
resume here, or nothing to resume --- and the reader should not have to infer
which from a mark.

**In Progress and To Do carry no prose.** Heading, rows, command. Nothing
explaining what the section is: a reader who cannot tell what *In Progress*
means will not be helped by a sentence saying it.

**Shown even when empty**, with their commands. Two empty listings *are* the
finding, and deleting them hides it.

**Preparation considerations** --- a label, like the headings above it, rather
than a sentence with a hedge in it. *Consideration* carries *not chosen* and
does not promise these are close, which *candidate* slightly does. Rows only.
**Up to three.**

**It is the last section above the rule**, because it is the one a reader with
work in progress skips. Everything they came for is above it.

**One sentence at the bottom if it is worth saying**, never in the middle: how
close any of this is to producing work. *"Neither has outcomes, so both are
several conversations away."* Below the rows, so somebody who only wanted the
names has already got them.

**Never offered as work.** It has not crossed the second gate, and offering it
mistakes a pile for a queue.

## Three divisions, named

**The big picture, next options, a recommendation.** They answer different
questions and a reader usually wants one of them, so each is named and a reader
can stop at the one they came for.

**The big picture** is where the work stands and what is worth worrying about.
Somebody checking in reads this and nothing else. **Risks belong here** --- a
concern is part of the picture, not part of the choice.

**Next options is a menu.** Options, ranked, and the reader chooses. **Not "where
to start"** --- nobody arriving at an existing backlog is starting, they are
continuing, and a heading that says otherwise is written for a project that
does not exist yet.

**Recommendation is one thing.** If the menu were enough there would be no need
to pick, and handing somebody three ranked options without saying which is
answering a question with a question.

**A division is a rule with its label inset. A section is bold text.**

```
──[ Overview ]──────────────────────────────────────────
```

**No markdown headings anywhere in the report**, and that is the point. `##` and
`###` render identically in a terminal, so heading level cannot divide anything
--- but a `###` section *does* outrank plain text, so mixing the two put the
sections above the divisions that contain them. Using none of it removes the
possibility.

**Everything here is literal text**, so what you write is what every reader
sees, in a terminal, a browser, or a file.

**Every rule ends at the same column.** Ragged ends read as a mistake. Sixty
characters.

**Short labels.** *Overview*, *Options*, *Recommendation* --- a long phrase
inside brackets reads as a sentence somebody boxed. The bracket is doing the
work of announcing a division; the label only has to name it.

**Sections are bold, not headings, and carry no rule.** They are inside a
division and should look it.

**Risks is omitted when there are none.** A manufactured concern costs more than
the section is worth and teaches a reader to skip it.

**Next options is one to five alternatives, ranked, a clause each.** Not a
plan --- a menu somebody can act on without reading twice. **The recommendation
is not among them.**

**Options, not candidates.** *Options* is the word somebody uses for a menu they
are choosing from; *candidate* implies the things are being assessed for
suitability, which is what the preparation list does and this one does not.

**Neither list asserts. Only the recommendation does.** Considerations are what
might be worth working out, options are what might be worth doing, and both are
handed over rather than urged.

**The recommendation is not repeated in the menu.** The menu holds what you
would do *instead*; the recommendation holds what you would do. Listing the pick
twice spends a line saying nothing --- a reader who has read one has read the
other.

**It does not have to come from the menu at all.** Sometimes the right answer is
none of the options, and forcing it into the list first, so it can be pulled out
again, is ceremony.

**Say what would change it** when something obvious would, usually a decision
nobody has made.

**Recommend nothing when nothing is right**, and say why. An empty
recommendation with a reason is worth more than a filled one without.
