title: Run down where the work stands
description: Run down where the work stands and what to pick up — what was last touched, what is under way, what is queued, and what is worth preparing — then recommend. Use when asked "what should I work on", "what's next", "what should I pick up", "where were we", "catch me up", "where do things stand", "anything I should be doing", or at the start of a session with no stated task. Do NOT use to display a record or a listing without choosing (backlog-show), and never to reorder or move anything.

# Run down where the work stands

**Three divisions, each named so a reader can stop at the one they came for.**

**Overview** --- where the work stands and what is worth worrying about, risks
included. **Options** --- a ranked menu. **Recommendation** --- the one thing,
which is not repeated in the menu.

**Inside the overview, order runs least to most immediate**, because a terminal
is read from the bottom: the last line printed sits at the cursor and costs
nothing, and everything above it costs a scroll. Preparation, then the queue,
then what is live, then risks, then where you left off.

**A division is a rule with its label inset**, `──[ Overview ]───…`, and a
section inside one is bold text. No markdown headings anywhere: `##` and `###`
render identically in a terminal so they cannot divide, and a `###` section
outranks plain text, so mixing them puts sections above the divisions that
contain them.

**The shape is [rundown](../templates/rundown.md)**, its listings are [listing](../templates/listing.md), and the marks
are [[showing-records]]. Do not invent a second format.

```
luma-backlog work-item list --json          # carries created and modified
luma-backlog work-item list --status in_progress
luma-backlog work-item list --status todo
luma-backlog work-item list --status preparing
luma-backlog work-item list --status prepared
luma-backlog work-item list --status captured
```

## Preparation considerations

**Only when there is nothing to do**, or when what is queued is thin.

Look at `preparing`, then `prepared`, then `captured`. **Three candidates at
most.**

- **Anything already `preparing`** — somebody started and stopped, which is the
  cheapest thing to finish.
- **Anything that blocks work already queued**, and say what it blocks. This one
  goes in whether or not it looks interesting: a blocker discovered late is the
  expensive kind.
- **Then whatever from `captured` looks like it will be wanted soon**, and say
  why you think so.

**Do not force it.** If nothing in the pile looks ready to work out, say that
and name the top one or two anyway — **not as recommendations but as a gauge**,
so somebody can see how far preparation actually is from producing anything.
*"Nothing here is close; the nearest is WORK-0001, and it needs a decision
first."*

**Never offer `captured` or `prepared` work as something to do.** It has not
crossed the second gate. Offering it mistakes a pile for a queue, and it is how
selection stops being a decision anybody makes.

---

## What is under way, and what is queued

**Both lists in full, in the shared format, in-progress first.**

Started work outranks queued work — not because it matters more, but because
**work in flight costs something every day it stays in flight and returns
nothing until it lands.**

**Several things `in_progress` for one worker is itself the finding** — a human
assignee, or an agent session. More was started than gets finished. Say it
plainly; recommending a sixth thing to start answers the question asked rather
than the one that matters.

**A team with many in flight is not the same thing**, and until an assignee
exists there is no way to tell the two apart — so say what you counted rather
than what it means.

**Blocked is not the same as slow.** Check the journal before calling something
stalled — [[backlog-show]].

**If both are empty, that is the answer and it is a strong one.** Nothing is
selected. The second gate is where attention is needed, not the work, and no
amount of reading further changes that.

## Risks and concerns

**The last of the overview, and honest.** What you noticed while reading that nobody
asked about.

**One bullet per risk**, so the count is read rather than counted — a run of
paragraphs makes one concern and four look alike. A bullet may run to a second
sentence, never to a paragraph, and whatever makes it checkable goes in the
first clause. **Plain bullets:** a risk is not a record and has no state, so the
marks in [[showing-records]] do not apply to it.

What to look for:

- Work `in_progress` with a journal silent for weeks — the status is a claim
  about the present and has stopped being true.
- A queue that has not moved while the pile grew.
- Work items that will collide, or one about to undo another.
- Anything queued whose blocker is not queued.
- A work item whose outcomes cannot be checked as written.

**Say nothing if there is nothing.** A manufactured concern costs more than the
section is worth, and it teaches a reader to skip it.

## What you last touched

**Git, not the records.** `--json` does not carry `modified`, and reading every
record to find out costs more than the answer is worth. `spec.md` §5.5 is
explicit that git is the machine record — every action is a commit — so recency
is a git question.

**One line, naming the record and roughly when.** *"Last touched WORK-0011,
about an hour ago — the help restyle."* Somebody returning after a break wants
their place back before they want advice.

**The stamp lies more often than you would think, and saying so is the answer.**
A work item's `modified` moves only when the work item's own file is written.
Adding a task, closing one, verifying an outcome, writing sixty journal lines ---
none of it touches the parent, because membership lives on the member. So a work
item somebody spent all day inside can look older than a record they created and
never opened again.

**Check the children before trusting the parent.** If the most recent stamps are
all on records nobody has worked on, the ordering is telling you when things were
*created*, not when they were *worked*. Say which you are reporting.

**Two or three sentences when the simple answer is wrong.** The one-line form is
for when it is right.

**Carry its state, and say which situation the reader is in.** The last record
touched is often a closed one --- somebody finished something and stopped --- and
that is a completely different position from having left mid-flight.

| what it is | what to say |
| --- | --- |
| open | **you were mid-something**, and it is where you resume. It outranks everything below. |
| closed | **you finished and stopped.** There is nothing to resume, so the rest of this report is the answer rather than the context. |

**A closed last-touched is good news, not a gap.** Stopping at a clean edge is
the best way to leave a session, and saying so is more useful than reporting a
record and letting somebody work out its state from the mark.

**Say when nothing was touched recently**, and say how long. A cold backlog and
a hot one call for different answers, and the reader can tell which they are in
faster than you can.

## Next options, then one recommendation

**One to five, ranked, with a clause each.** Not a plan — a shortlist somebody
can act on without reading twice.

> 1. **Finish WORK-0011** — the only thing in progress, and two of its outcomes
>    are provable now.
> 2. **Prepare WORK-0001** — it blocks the migration work already queued.
> 3. **Verify the two outcomes on WORK-0011** — ten minutes, and the record
>    stops understating itself.

**Rank on what unblocks the most, then on what is nearly done.** Do not weigh it
further than that; a ranking nobody can follow the reasoning of is a list.

**Say what would change the order** when something obvious would — usually a
decision nobody has made.

**If the honest answer is "nothing, and here is why", give that.** An empty
recommendation with a reason is worth more than a filled one without.

## What a good one reads like

Shape is [rundown](../templates/rundown.md); this is the judgment, which is the part that does not
come from a template.

**What that example is doing**, since the shape is easy to copy and the
substance is not:

- **The stamp is corrected rather than repeated.** The obvious answer was wrong
  and saying why took two sentences.
- **Every risk carries a number or a name.** Fifty-seven commits, 9 to 23, never
  --- each one is checkable.
- **One risk is not about the backlog at all.** Unpushed work is the kind of
  thing a report that only reads records will always miss.
- **The menu is ranked on consequence**, not on effort.
- **The pick is not on the menu.** It is a different kind of thing from the
  three below it --- they are all more work, it is the one that reduces risk ---
  and repeating it would have cost a line to say nothing.
- **Nothing is offered as work that has not been selected.** WORK-0011 appears
  as a preparation candidate and in the recommendations --- never as *next*.
