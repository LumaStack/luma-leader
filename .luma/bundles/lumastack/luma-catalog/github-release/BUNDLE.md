# GitHub release

Releasing is where a project's care becomes visible to people who will never
read its source. A version number is a promise about what upgrading costs, and
release notes are usually the only account of a change anyone ever reads.

Both are easy to get wrong in ways that are invisible at the time and expensive
later — a breaking change shipped as a minor, a tag pushed with no release
against it, notes that list commits instead of consequences.

## What is here

- [[publish-release]] — the procedure. Verifies `gh` is installed,
  authenticated and working *in this repository* before anything is tagged.
- [[release-versions]] — which part to bump, and the two cases that must be said
  out loud. Enough to cut a release; the reasoning is in the **versioning**
  bundle, worth adopting alongside and not required by this one.
- [[release-notes]] — what a release is called and what it must contain.
- [[changelog]] — `CHANGELOG.md`, following Keep a Changelog, and how it differs
  from release notes.
- [the release notes template](templates/release-notes.md) — the required
  sections in order, with the reasoning in comments.

## Project only

`consumers: [project]` — releasing is a repository activity. An organization's
headquarters is a repository too, but it is not something you cut versions of.

## Loading

**Nothing here is loaded before work starts, and nothing needs to be.** No
document declares `matches: always`. [[publish-release]] declares no `matches` at
all: it is named as a skill and its body arrives when somebody invokes it, which
is the right outcome for a procedure nobody runs by accident.

**All three policies declare triggers**, which is what makes them cheap —
[[changelog]] on the `CHANGELOG.md` path, [[release-notes]] on the
`gh release create` command and the `before-release` event, and
[[release-versions]] on that same event and on the topic of choosing which part
of a version to bump. They arrive when the procedure reaches them or when someone
questions a version number, rather than being held in context against the
possibility.

## The one hard requirement

The procedure **stops** if `gh` is missing rather than falling back to the web
interface or a raw API call. The first produces a release nobody can reproduce;
the second needs a token that then has to live somewhere.

When it stops it **asks** whether to install `gh` or leave that to you, and
waits. Installing software is outside what "publish a release" implies, harder
to undo than anything else in the procedure, and on a managed machine it may not
be yours to do.

## Version

`0.9.0` — **a release title is the version and nothing else, and a section with
nothing to say is left out.**

**Titles.** `vX.Y.Z`, no dash and no summary. What changed moves to the opening
line of the notes, one line below. Saying it in both places is one fact written
twice at the same moment and amended separately afterwards — and the title is
the copy that cannot be fixed, because feeds and unfurls cache it on the day it
publishes. It also makes the release name, the tag and the version field one
string with nothing to parse off the end before any two can be compared.

*What it gives up is stated rather than glossed:* a reader scanning bare
versions cannot tell which release affects them without opening one. The opening
line is now required, because it is the only summary a release has.

**Omission.** Every section below that opening line is conditional, and a
heading reading *none* or *nothing to do* costs a stop and returns nothing.
Absence is the statement, and the policy says so — which is what makes it
readable rather than an author having forgotten.

*This resolves a contradiction the document already had.* The banner said
*"delete the whole line when nothing breaks"* while `Upgrading` was told to say
*nothing to do* out loud. One document, two answers to the same question.

Minor rather than patch: **a reader who correctly understood `0.8.1` now behaves
differently**, which is the test every patch entry below turns on. Not breaking
by this bundle's own definition — no document removed or renamed, no Type
Definition touched, no `matches` gained or lost.

*Stage and survival both checked and both unchanged:* still `draft`, still
`intended`. Publication and adoption make the promotion question live rather
than answering it, and the answer is still that its shape can reverse without
notice.

`0.6.4` — **the manifest declares `lifecycle: draft`.** The field was absent, and
absent reads as `unknown` — *nobody has said*. Something was known: this is
developed by its maintainers for their own use, and its shape can reverse
without notice.

**Publication did not promote it.** Being reachable by somebody who did not
write it makes the question live rather than answering it, and the answer here
is *still a draft* — which is a legitimate thing to publish, and says more than
silence did.

Patch: a fact written down. Nothing an adopter is obliged to do has changed, and
`unknown` promised nothing that `draft` withdraws.

`0.6.3` — **references to the knowledge format name sections instead of numbering them.** The format removed section numbers, so every `§n` here pointed at a position that no longer exists — and a stale number resolves to the wrong section rather than to nothing, which is why none of them were reported. Decorative citations are dropped; the rest name what they meant.

Patch: wording only. No rule, field or procedure changed.

`0.6.2` — **`entry_point` is now `entrypoint`.** One word, so the same word names the same thing at every level it appears.

**Also: a release-title example named `preload`**, which the format released
in `v0.0.12`. An example's content is arbitrary, so it cost nothing to stop
teaching a dead word from published material.

Patch: one key renamed. Same value, same meaning, same `optional` presence, and `luma-foreman` reads both spellings while the rename lands.

`0.6.1` — **bundle IDs in this catalog gained their namespace.** A bundle here
is `lumastack/luma-catalog/<name>` rather than `luma/<name>`, because the
namespace now derives from where the catalog lives instead of being declared.
Every reference in this bundle's prose is updated.

**A fork can no longer publish under this catalog's name.** It lives somewhere
else, so it is named something else, and its bundles sit beside these in a
project rather than colliding with them.

*Type names are unaffected.* `type: luma/catalog` and its siblings name the
format, not this catalog, and resolve separately.

Patch: nothing but the identifiers a reference points at.

`0.6.0` — **the Loading section described a removed field, and miscounted.** It
claimed `publish-release` was `preload: mandatory` and that *the two policies*
were `optional`. There are three policies, every one of them declaring triggers,
and nothing here is loaded before work starts — `publish-release` declares no
`matches` and is reached as a skill.

The triggers are now named individually, because *cheap* is a claim a reader
should be able to check rather than take.

Minor. No document's frontmatter changed; the description of it did.

`0.5.0` — **`applies_to` is now `matches`.** The old name obliged an author to
write a false sentence: `applies_to: everything` claims a rule governs
everything, and none does — what a rule governs is stated in its body, where no
frontmatter value reaches. The field says what makes a Document *surface*, which
is smaller and true, and it reads as a sentence in every form it takes: matches
`git commit`, matches always, matches nothing.

**The default reverses with it.** A Document that says nothing is now available
on request rather than loaded into every session. Nothing here is affected —
every rule in this bundle already states what surfaces it — but a rule that
genuinely should always be present now says `matches: always` rather than
staying silent and being treated as though it had.

Minor. Nothing a reader is obliged to do has changed; the field it is declared
in has been renamed, and `applies_to` is still read while the rename finishes.

`0.4.0` — **vocabulary.** `moment` becomes `event` — a moment is a point in
time and `applies_to` takes nouns. `compliance` is dropped wherever it was
saying nothing: a policy binds unless it says otherwise, so only a strong
default declares `recommended`, and a workflow's steps bind by being steps.
Type Definitions use `field_presence: required` for what was
`obligation: mandatory`, matching the format.

Minor. Nothing a reader is obliged to do has changed; what declares it has.

`0.3.0` — **`preload` is replaced by `compliance` and `applies_to`.** An author
now says how strongly a rule binds and when it governs; *when it is delivered* is
computed from those and never declared. Every rule here could state when it
applies, so **nothing in this bundle is loaded unconditionally any more** — it
arrives when the work matches and costs nothing before then.

Minor: a consumer reading `preload` finds nothing, and the loading behaviour of
every document changes.

`0.2.0` — **the manifest is `BUNDLE.md`.** Reserved markdown files are now
ALL CAPS across the estate, because nobody types all caps by accident: a file
becomes load-bearing only when somebody deliberately made it so, and writing
`bundle.md` now fails in the safe direction — ignored rather than silently wired
into machinery. Minor rather than patch, and pre-1.0 that is the tier for a
breaking change: anything naming the old path by hand stops resolving.

`0.1.2` — a heading no longer says how many things are beneath it. Wording only.

Patch: no normative sentence moved and a reader who correctly understood
`0.1.1` behaves identically. See `writing-style` in `lumastack/luma-catalog/project-documentation`
for the rule and the failure it prevents.

`0.1.1` — *standard* becomes *policy*. Wording only: `policy` is the document
type the format defines and the word this estate uses everywhere else, and
`standard` was deliberately freed for the organization level rather than left
doing double duty.

Patch because a reader who correctly understood `0.1.0` behaves identically.
The subject noun changed; nothing it requires, permits or forbids did.

`0.1.0`. The conventions here are drawn from releases actually cut rather than
imagined, but the workflow's `gh` handling has not yet been run against a
machine that does not have it — which is the case it exists for.
